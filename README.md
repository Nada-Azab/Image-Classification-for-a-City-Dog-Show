# Image-Classification-for-a-City-Dog-Show
###My tasks in project:
>Using your Python skills, you will determine which image classification algorithm works the "best" on classifying images as "dogs" or "not dogs".

>Determine how well the "best" classification algorithm works on correctly identifying a dog's breed. If you are confused by the term image classifier look at it simply as a tool that has an input and an output. The Input is an image. The output determines what the image depicts. (for example, a dog). Be mindful of the fact that image classifiers do not always categorize the images correctly.

>Time how long each algorithm takes to solve the classification problem. With computational tasks, there is often a trade-off between accuracy and runtime. The more accurate an algorithm, the higher the likelihood that it will take more time to run and use more computational resources to run.
